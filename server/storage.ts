Not the silence of sleep, nor the silence after death, but the silence of a world unborn. There was no earth, no sky, no air. Only a vast and endless sea of shadowed waters stretched into eternity. This was Nu, the limitless expanse, the boundless nothingness from which all would rise.`,

He was the dark water, the eternal tide, the father of beginnings and the grave of endings. Yet even Nu, vast and unending, felt the ache of loneliness. From his depths came the first companions – shapes born from his essence.`,

Together, they drifted through Nu's waters, shaping balance – the limits and the limitless, the night and the eternal expanse.`,

Beside him rose Mut, the Mother, vast yet gentle, her embrace wide enough to hold worlds not yet born. Together they stood, and in their union, creation felt the stirrings of order.`,

There was no earth, no sky, no air. Only a vast and endless sea of shadowed waters stretched into eternity. This was Nu, the limitless expanse, the boundless nothingness from which all would rise.

The waters were heavy with possibility, yet empty of form. Within Nu drifted the seeds of gods not yet awakened, destinies unspoken, and worlds that had not yet drawn breath.

And in that endless depth, the stillness began to tremble.

A whisper moved through the waters – a stirring, a breath. Creation longed to be born, and the first story began.`,

In the boundless expanse of his being, all possibilities swirled like currents beneath a moonless sky. Here, time had no meaning, for there was no sun to mark its passage. Space held no boundaries, for there were no shores to contain the endless sea.

Yet within this apparent emptiness lay the greatest abundance. Every star that would shine, every grain of sand that would shift, every heartbeat that would echo through eternity – all resided in Nu's infinite embrace.

The waters spoke in whispers older than sound, carrying stories that had never been told. And from these primordial depths, the first stirring of consciousness began to rise.`,

Kek emerged as the embodiment of the primordial darkness, not as absence but as potential. His darkness was the fertile void where all things gestated before birth. In his realm, concepts took shape before becoming real, dreams crystallized into destiny.

Beside him stirred Heh, the personification of infinity itself. Where Kek was the bounded darkness that made light meaningful, Heh was the endless expanse that gave context to all finite things. Together, they established the fundamental rhythm of existence – the bounded and the boundless, the finite and the eternal.

Their dance created the first cosmic music, a rhythm that would pulse through all creation. In the interplay of Kek's defining shadows and Heh's limitless expanse, the stage was set for form to emerge from formlessness.`,

Amun arose as the Hidden One, the god whose essence could never be fully grasped or contained. He was the breath behind all breath, the will behind all action, the invisible force that moves the seen world. Even his fellow gods would struggle to comprehend his true nature, for Amun was the mystery that dwells at the heart of all mysteries.

With him came Mut, the Great Mother, whose womb would nurture all that was to come. She was not merely a vessel for creation, but creation's own wisdom and protective embrace. In her eyes blazed the fierce love that would defend the young cosmos from the chaos that forever sought to reclaim it.

Together, Amun and Mut established the pattern of hidden wisdom and manifest nurturing that would echo through all divine relationships. The Hidden and the Mother – the unknowable truth and the protective love that makes existence possible.`,
