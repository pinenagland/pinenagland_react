    title: "The Silence Before All",
    chapterNumber: 0,
    narrative: `Before the first dawn, before the river sang, before sand and star were named, there was silence. Not the silence of sleep, nor the silence after death, but the silence of a world unborn. There was no earth, no sky, no air. Only a vast and endless sea of shadowed waters stretched into eternity. This was Nu, the limitless expanse, the boundless nothingness from which all would rise. And in that endless depth, the stillness began to tremble. A whisper moved through the waters – a stirring, a breath. Creation longed to be born, and the first story began.`,
    commentary: "The ancient Egyptian creation myth begins not with a bang, but with infinite potential. Nu represents the primordial chaos from which all order emerges, a concept that echoes through many world mythologies.",

  const chapter1: BookChapter = {

    title: "Nu – The Infinite Waters",
    chapterNumber: 1,
    narrative: `Nu was not god in the way others would be – with temples and names sung in hymns – but rather the canvas upon which existence would be painted. He was the dark water, the eternal tide, the father of beginnings and the grave of endings. Yet even Nu, vast and unending, felt the ache of loneliness. He drifted within himself, tides folding upon tides, whispering: "What use is infinity if no one bears witness to its depth?" From his depths came the first companions – shapes born from his essence.`,
    commentary: "Nu represents the concept of primordial chaos that exists before creation. Unlike the destructive chaos we often imagine, Nu is pregnant with potential – the source from which all order and meaning emerge.",

    chapterNumber: 2,
    narrative: `From the still waters of Nu, shapes began to stir. The first was Kek, the god of shadow, cloaked in eternal dusk. Beside him rose Heh, the god of infinity, vast and unending. Kek spoke first: "I am the veil. I am the silence before the cry." Heh's laughter was like distant thunder: "And I am the stretch of eternity." Together, they drifted through Nu's waters, shaping balance – the limits and the limitless, the night and the eternal expanse.`,
    commentary: "Kek and Heh represent fundamental forces in Egyptian cosmology – the balance between darkness and infinity, between limits and limitlessness. They establish the first cosmic dualities from which more complex creation can emerge.",

    title: "Amun & Mut – The Hidden and the Mother",
    chapterNumber: 3,
    narrative: `From the waters of Nu came Amun, the Hidden One – unseen, unknowable, unfathomable. He was not shadow, nor light, nor sky, nor earth – but something between. Beside him rose Mut, the Mother, vast yet gentle, her embrace wide enough to hold worlds not yet born. Together they stood, and in their union, creation felt the stirrings of order. Where Amun was unseen, Mut gave form. Where Mut offered life, Amun lent spirit.`,
    commentary: "Amun and Mut represent the balance between the hidden and the revealed, the mysterious and the nurturing. Their partnership establishes the foundation for both divine kingship and the protection of life.",

    narrative: `From the deep rose a mound, a swelling of earth breaking the surface of chaos. Upon this sacred mound stood Tatenen – the risen land, the father of soil, mountains, and valleys. He rose high above the waters, green and fertile, crowned with the lotus of creation. His voice was deep and steady: "I am the mound that endures when the flood withdraws. I am the earth beneath all feet."`,
    commentary: "Tatenen represents the primordial mound from which all land emerges. In Egyptian cosmology, this sacred hill is the first solid ground, the foundation upon which temples and civilization will be built.",

    narrative: `From the union of Amun and Mut, a child of silver light emerged – Khonsu, the Moon. He rose quietly, with soft glow that shimmered across the waters. His crown bore the lunar disk embraced by a crescent. "I am the traveler, the wanderer of the night sky. With me, time shall be divided." And so it was that time began to move – days into nights, nights into days.`,
    commentary: "Khonsu represents the measurement of time and the lunar calendar that governed Egyptian religious and agricultural life. As the moon god, he bridges the realms of night and day.",

Each turn of his wheel brought forth new possibilities, each touch of his fingers granted the spark of existence. He was the craftsman of creation, the divine artisan who gave form to the formless.`,
    commentary: "Khnum represents the creative principle that shapes individual life. As the potter god, he symbolizes the careful crafting of each soul and the divine attention given to every living being.",

She was the weaver of what was, what is, and what shall be – the divine seamstress who stitched together the fabric of existence.`,
